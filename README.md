# Neural Network Option Pricing

Project for the Machine Learning for Finance course.

The goal is to test whether a feed-forward neural network can accurately
approximate the Black-Scholes pricing function for European call options.

## Core Question

Can a feed-forward neural network approximate the Black-Scholes European call
pricing function with high accuracy, and how does it compare with analytical
Black-Scholes prices and Monte Carlo estimates?

Generated experiment artifacts are written to `data/` and `outputs/`.
These directories are ignored by Git because they can be reproduced from the
code and configuration. The report and presentation PDFs are tracked because
they are final project deliverables. Selected final metrics and figures are
tracked in `results/final/`.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
```

Run the complete experiment:

```bash
python scripts/run_experiment.py
```

Use `--data-dir` and `--output-dir` to keep different runs separate:

```bash
python scripts/run_experiment.py \
  --data-dir data/intermediate \
  --output-dir outputs/intermediate
```

For a fast smoke test:

```bash
python scripts/run_experiment.py \
  --n-samples 10000 \
  --max-epochs 40 \
  --batch-size 1024 \
  --mc-n-paths 5000 \
  --mc-evaluation-samples 128
```

The run generates:

- synthetic option data in `data/`;
- trained model checkpoint in `outputs/`;
- experiment configuration snapshot in `outputs/experiment_config.json`;
- metrics in `outputs/metrics/`;
- figures in `outputs/figures/`.

## Testing

Run the automated test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests cover analytical Black-Scholes pricing, synthetic dataset generation,
Monte Carlo pricing, and a small end-to-end pipeline smoke test.

## Documentation

Build the Sphinx documentation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build/html
```

For a clean environment, install the runtime requirements and the local package
before building the API documentation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
```

Open `docs/build/html/index.html` in a browser to read the generated
documentation.

## Report and Presentation

The technical report is written in LaTeX:

```bash
cd report
latexmk -xelatex main.tex
```

The oral presentation is written with Beamer:

```bash
cd presentation
latexmk -xelatex main.tex
```

Both documents use XeLaTeX.
